% MultiProjPot_conv_test_0.m tests the projected potential generated by
% MultiProjPot_conv_0.m. Note that the sample used is not realistic
% material, it is specially designed.
% This script was run on my laptop, the old version, ProjectedPotential_0.m
% , took 586.617s; and the new version, MultiProjPot_conv_0.m took 43.050s.

%% Prepare the sample:
lattConst = [4, 6, 0]; % [a, b] in Angstrom
M = 2;
expanNum = M * [3, 2];
crysMat = [22,  0.5,  0,    1,    0;...
           14,  1,  0,    0.5,  0;...
           50,  0.9,  0.5,  1,    0;...
           14,  1,  0.5,  0.5,  0;...
           14,  1,  0.25, 0.75, 0;...
           14,  1,  0.75, 0.25, 0]';
%% Sampling settings:
Lx = expanNum(1) * lattConst(1);
Ly = expanNum(2) * lattConst(2);
Nx = 512;
Ny = 512;
dx = Lx / Nx;
dy = Ly / Ny;
x = -Lx / 2 : dx : Lx / 2 - dx;
y = -Ly / 2 : dy : Ly / 2 - dy;
%% Generate the projected potential in the old way:
% Expand the lattice:
slices = SquareLattExpanX(crysMat, lattConst, expanNum, 1.0e-5);
projPotOld = ProjectedPotential_1(Lx, Ly, Nx, Ny, slices);
% Show the result:
figure;
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imagesc(x, y, projPotOld);
colorbar; axis square;
title('old');
subplot(1, 2, 2);
plot(x, projPotOld(Ny / 2 + 1, : ));
%% Generate the projected potential in the new way;
projPotNew = MultiProjPot_conv_X(crysMat, expanNum, lattConst, Lx, Ly, Nx, Ny);
% Show the result:
figure;
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imagesc(x, y, projPotNew);
colorbar; axis square;
title('new');
subplot(1, 2, 2);
plot(x, projPotNew(Ny / 2 + 1, :));
